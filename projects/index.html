        				This is my current project.  I want to understand what makes a player Hall of Fame worthy 
						as well as try to predict current players likelihood of making it.  My focus will be on 
						batters only.  I'll save pitching for another day.

         		This was a project I worked on during my Applied Data Analytics class to learn more on the concepts presented.
			I narrowed down key MLB pitching and batting stats to predict total wins on the season.

  <p>These are examples of card styles that are used in Mustard UI.  We like to think of it as a starter CSS framework that actually looks good.  We'd love to hear your feedback!</p>
